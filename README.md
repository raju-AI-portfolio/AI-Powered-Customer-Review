# 🤖 AI-Powered Customer Review Insights Pipeline

An automated N8N-based no-code Generative AI workflow that analyzes customer product reviews using LLMs (GPT-4 / Mistral), generates structured insights, logs results to Google Sheets, and sends alerts for negative feedback.
---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project automates the analysis of customer reviews for products such as **XSound Pro Headphones** (or any product).

Instead of manually reviewing hundreds of customer reviews, this workflow:

- Generates concise AI-powered summaries
- Performs sentiment analysis (Positive / Negative / Neutral)
- Classifies summary tone (Informative / Persuasive / Friendly)
- Calculates confidence scores
- Logs structured insights into Google Sheets
- Sends email alerts for negative reviews

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual review analysis is:
- Time-consuming  
- Inconsistent  
- Prone to bias  
- Difficult to scale  

This workflow solves the problem by:

✅ Reducing processing time from hours to minutes  
✅ Ensuring consistent AI-based sentiment detection  
✅ Providing structured insights for Sales, Marketing, and Product teams  
✅ Triggering instant alerts for negative customer feedback
